    <h1>Star Wars: The High Republic</h1>
    <h2>Official Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Star Wars: The High Republic, which has previously been referred to as “Project Luminous,” 
      will be set in an era when the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order are at their zenith,
      about 200 years before the events of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. This period on the 
      Star Wars timeline will not overlap any of the filmed features or series currently planned 
      for production, giving creators and partners a vast amount of room to tell Star Wars stories 
      with new adventures and original characters. 
    </p>
    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>The High Republic is split into waves within phases. Three phases have been announced so far:
      <ol>
        <li>Light of the Jedi</li>
        <li>Quest of the Jedi</li>
        <li>Trials of the Jedi</li>
      </ol>
      Each phase contains three waves which bring a wide variety of content into the Star Wars Expanded Universe.
      Since The High Republic is a multimedia publishing initiative, the contents of each wave ranges from novels 
      for a variety of age groups to audiobooks to comics to manga.
